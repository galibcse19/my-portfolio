## Purpose:
The Projects component in your React application serves as an interactive portfolio to showcase your web development work. It highlights various projects you’ve worked on, providing viewers with a detailed description of each project’s features, tools used, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories. By utilizing the Swiper library, the projects are presented in a carousel format, allowing users to easily browse through them. This component not only demonstrates your technical skills as a full-stack developer, using technologies like React, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and Stripe, but it also serves as a way to build professional credibility. The clickable links to live sites and code repositories allow potential clients or employers to explore your work firsthand, see the code behind it, and better understand your development capabilities. Ultimately, the Projects component is designed to make your portfolio engaging and accessible, while demonstrating your ability to implement various technologies to create functional, full-featured web applications.
